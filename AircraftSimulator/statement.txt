Statement of Completeness:
- Completed all Aircraft and Passenger classes

- Tested for all methods (that we could think of) in Aircraft and Passenger classes

- GUI runs

- Error/Validation handling is present for the GUI text input

- The text output is present

- Ability to input arguments into the console is not present, but you can customise inputs in the GUI.
    - Log files and chart reflects changes in GUI inputs

- There is an alternative commented main method, where we attempted to write the code for console imports, but couldnt finish.

- 'Swap Chart' button does nothing. There is no second chart to choose from.
